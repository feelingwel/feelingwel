        <p>In January of 2023, during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP), I worked in the <a href="https://www.marelli.mit.edu/">Laboratory for Advanced Biopolymers</a> on research investigating the use of silk fibroin to increase the efficacy of phosphorus biofertilizers. </p>
        
        <p>Phosphorus, a nutrient vital to plants and all living beings, is usually found in insoluble forms in phosphate rocks. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria can break these rocks down into soluble forms plants can uptake, however they must be kept alive (1) until the fertilizer is applied and (2) in the new environment they are applied to. The silk fibroin protein creates a protective film that allows the bacteria to survive in harsh environments (i.e. the biofertilizer may dry until applied to soil) and prevents them from being outcompeted by local bacteria. 
        </p>

        <p>I worked on the initial experimental design of this project, identifying ways to measure the amount of phosphorus solubilized and the amount of live bacteria. Over the course of the month, I prepared samples, collected microscopy images and data, and found myself having to apply my chemistry and material knowledge in the field of environmental engineering.
