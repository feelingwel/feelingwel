        <p>In 3.155: Micro/Nano Processing Technology, an interdepartmental course in the materials science and electrical engineering departments, I spent every week going into MIT Nano, MIT's nanofabrication lab, to explore the processing techniques of solar cells, MEMS devices, and transistors. For the course's final project, I combined two of the devices and wanted to test if a basic MEMS cantilever design could work as a transistor. The process certainly was not perfect and this would be something to explore more in the future if I got the chance, but I was able to get surprising data out of the experience! The results were presented in a final paper and class presentation. </p>
