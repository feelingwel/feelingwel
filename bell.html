        <h2 class="heading">Bell Alloy Design and Characterization</h2>

        <p>During the spring of my senior year, I took my department's capstone class, 3.042: Materials Project Laboratory. Over the course of 3 months, my group and I investigated western bells and bell bronze (typically 80% Cu and 20% Sn by weight), what about the alloy contributes to the acoustic and mechanical properties of bells, and attempted to design an acoustically and mechanically superior bell alloy using titanium. </p>

        <br>

        <p>This project was challenging for two main reasons: first, the team lacked the metallurgical knowledge and experience required to get us started on the experiment right away; second, not everyone had the same level of teamwork skills or compatibility. As a course that is designed to prepare students for the workforce, whether in academia or in industry, we got exposed to the demands of working with all types of people early on. While our group began the semester with hesitation, we were able to adapt to each group member's communication style as we used each other's strengths to complete the project successfully.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Our results reinforced a balance of material properties: as we attempted to enhance the mechanical properties of the bronze, the acoustics suffered. However, being able to complete this project within 3 months, learning metallurgical concepts and how to sand cast, and overcoming group communication issues made this experience incredibly invaluable.
