    <h2>Designing and Testing a simple RF MEMS Cantilever Design</h2>
    <p>
        In 3.155: Micro/Nano Processing Technology, an interdepartmental course in the materials science and electrical engineering departments, I spent every week going
        into MIT Nano, MIT's nanofabrication lab, to explore the processing techniques of solar cells, MEMS devices, and transistors. For the final project, I combined
        two of the devices and wanted to test if a basic MEMS cantilever design could work as a transistor. The process certainly was not perfect and this would be
        something to explore more in the future if I got the chance, but I surprisingly got decent results out of it.
